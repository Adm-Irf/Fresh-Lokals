# FreshLokals – Malaysian Local Grocery Marketplace 🥬🇲🇾

## 📌 Introduction
FreshLokals is an e-commerce prototype built by a group of Year 2 Computer Science students.  
It highlights Malaysian local grocery products through a simple and responsive interface.

The project uses **Vite + React** for the frontend and **Java + CSV storage** for the backend.  
We also added **PayPal Sandbox integration** to show how an online payment works without using real money.

## ✨ Features
- Clean and responsive UI built with React
- Local Malaysian grocery categories
- CSV-based product and order storage
- PayPal Sandbox checkout demo
- Simple and lightweight architecture

---

## 💳 PayPal Sandbox Integration
This project uses PayPal Sandbox to simulate online payments.  
It walks through the full flow:
1. Add items to cart  
2. Proceed to checkout  
3. Complete mock payment  
4. Return status to the website  

This gives a realistic experience without using real money.

## 🌿 About the Project
FreshLokals is designed to support Malaysian local sellers.  
The platform gives users a simple way to browse items, add them to cart and simulate a full checkout flow.  
The project structure is intentionally straightforward to make it easy for students to read and extend.
